where to instantiate sensors:
	1. define outside and pass in
	2. pass in data and instantiate from there
	3. hardcode it into the module class


	1 wastes memory and is not OOP
	3 is terrible, what if different modules etc
	2 is best :)


how to implement?
	__init__(self, array of sensor config?)

	__init__(self, anaConfigArray, digiConfigArray)

Challenges:
	it's hard when you don't have the specific unit to work with
	the hardware informs your software and it's very useful to be able to prod it
	also the physical hardware is good for orienting yourself, conflating ana out with an ana sensor for instance


structure:
	as it stands, i'm emulating the state of the sensors and module, with no hooks to pass it through so we can work it out
